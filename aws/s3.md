title: "S3"
---

- 0 - 5TB. Universal namespace. Upload returns HTTP 200.
- Read after write consistency for PUTS of new Objects
- Eventual consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES - NOW Strongly consistent
- MFA Deletes
- 99.99% availability design
- 99.9% guaranteed availably
- 11 9’s Durability
- S3 Standard - sustain loss of 2 facilities concurrently
- S3 - IA - retrieval fee
- S3 One Zone - IA (formerly reduced redundancy storage RRS)
- S3 - Intelligent Tiering - most cost-effective via ML
- S3 Glacier - retrieval configurable mins to hours
- S3 Glacier Deep Archive - 12 hrs retrieval
- Cross Region Replication
- S3 Transfer Acceleration - upload to edges (get a distinct URL), then back to bucket

- Cost:

    - Storage
    - Requests
    - data transfer
    - replication

- Versioning
    - Must make each version public individually, setting latest version public doesn’t cascade
    - Once enabled, can’t be disabled, just suspended
    - Includes all writes and delete
    - Has MFA Delete
- Lifecycle management - can be current versions and previous versions
- S3 Object Lock - Write Once, ready many (WORM) - retention period. Indiv obj or buckets
    - Governance Mode - can be changed w/ special permissions
    - Compliance Mode - can’t be changed even by root
    - Legal Hold - in effect until removed
- Glacier Vault Lock
- Performance
  - Prefix - mybucket/folder1/subfolder1/object.jpg
  - First byte latency 100-200 ms
  - 3500 req/sec per prefix PUT/COPY/POST/DELETE
  - 5500 GET/HEAD
  - Spread across prefixes to achieve more reqs/sec
  - SSE-KMS KMS Limits for the API : upload -> GenerateDataKey; download -> Decrypt
  - KMS quota is region specific: 5500, 10000, 30000 req/sec. Can’t request increase ATM
  - Multipart Uploads
    - Recommended > 100 MB; required > 5 GB
    - Parallelize uploads
  - Downloads - byte-range fetches (parallelize downloads by byte ranges)
    - Speed up downloads
    - Get partial amounts (like header)
- S3 Select - SQL expressions to only retrieve what’s needed (~ 400% faster/ 80% cheaper)
- Glacier Select
- Sharing buckets across accounts:
  - Using bucket policies & IAM - applies to entire bucket. programmatic access only
  - Using Bucket ACLS & IAM - aplies to individual objects. programmatic
  - Cross-account IAM Roles - programmatic and console
- Cross Region Replication
  - Will require versioning to be turned on for source and destination
  - Only begins when set up - existing objects not automatically replicated
  - Permissions (public) now replicate to other regions
  - Virtual-host style URLs favored over path-style

## Athena & Macie

- Athena is a query service to query data in S3 as standard SQL
  - Serverless
  - No need for ETL
  - Useful for log data ELB Logs, S3 access logs, click stream data, etc
  - Works with JSON, Apache Parquet, Apache ORC
- Macie - security service using ML and NLP to recognize if s3 contain sensitive data to discover PII. CloudTrail logs, etc
