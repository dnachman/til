title: "Route53"
---

- DNS - Port 53
  - IPv4 - 32 bit field, 4 billion addresses
  - IPv6 - 128 bits
  - Internet Assigned Numbers Authority - TLD
  - Registrars - interNic, ICANN
  - Time To Live - TTL
  - SOA - Start of Authority
  - NS - Name Server
  - A - Address
  - MX, PTR (map ip to name)
  - CName - Canonical Name - map one domain name to another. Canâ€™t be used for naked domain names (zone apex record)
  - Alias - map resource record sets in your hosted zone to AWS services. (In exam, always choose Alias record?)
  - ELBs never have a pre-defined IPv4 address, always resolve with DNS name
- Routing
  - Simple - 1 record w/ multiple IP addresses -> return all in random order
  - Weighted - allows you to split based on weights. set-id. health checks (SNS notifications, removed from DNS until healthy)
  - Latency-based - route based on lowest network latency for user
  - Failover - for active/passive set up. primary will need health check
  - Geolocation - route based on the location of user. use cases: european customers have specific set of servers (maybe b/c configured w/ language or SLA)
  - Geoproximity - Traffic Flow Only. Bias expands or shrinks the size of the geographic region
  - Multivalue Answer - like simple routing but allows you to put health check on each record set
